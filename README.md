# Battle Of Mesoketes

## Problem Description:

You are watching the battle of Mesoketes, that had a big wall that covered the
city on all sides. The wall was built by the Maygans to protect against military
incursions from the North. For the purposes of this problem, the wall is a
square. We assume that the builder used a reactive strategy: whenever a side
of the wall was attacked successfully, the Wall on that side would be raised to
the height sufficient to stop an identical attack in the future.
The north border of Mesoketes was frequently attacked by nomadic tribes. For
the purposes of this problem, we assume that each tribe attacks the wall with
some strength S and in a direction (the strength defines the height at impact).
In order to repel the attack, the Wall must have height S all along the defended
side of the wall. If the height on that side of the Wall is lower than needed, the
attack will breach the Wall at this point and succeed. Note that even a
successful attack does not damage the Wall. After the attack, every attacked
fragment of the Wall that was lower than S is raised to height S â€” in other
words, the Wall is increased in the minimal way that would have stopped the
attack. Note that if two or more attacks happened on the exact same day, the
Wall was raised only after they all resolved, and is raised in the minimum way
that would stop all of them.
Assuming that initially (in 250 BC) the Wall was nonexistent (i.e., of height zero
everywhere), and given the full description of all the nomadic tribes that
attacked the Wall, determine how many of the attacks were successful. Also
assume that the city was under attack for a period of 3 days

## Input should have the following format:

````
